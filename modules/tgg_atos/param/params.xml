		You can define in this file parameters to add or override when Tgg_Atos is calling the request binary file,
		avoiding modifying any of the files which could be updated later.
		!! Do NOT use Parmcom key syntax, key-value pairs will be directly sent as request call parameters, overriding any module generated or configured value, except for pathfile which can't be overridden !!
		This file is the best way to set template related ATOS vars for exemple, see "ATOS PAGES CUSTOMIZATION" documentation.

			Add here additionnal parameters that applies to all payment modes
			Use CDATA section to wrap values
			exemple:
				<language><![CDATA[en]]></language>
			will set 'language=en' in the commandline parameters when calling request binary file, forcing payment page language to english (which is kind of a bad idea cause you can also override that setting from configuration page, but is a exemple simple enough to be understood) -->
			!! DO NOT FORGET CDATA WRAPPER !!
			!! READ CAREFULLY "DATA DICTIONNARY" PART OF ATOS/SIPS DOCUMENTATION !!
			!! 'pathfile' cannot be overriden because it is set after parsing this file, it didn't change this way of working because i didn't see the point of it, let me know if I'm wrong !!
